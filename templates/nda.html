THIS AGREEMENT (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) is entered into on this &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; day of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; by and between &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, doing business at &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (the &ldquo;Disclosing Party&rdquo;), and &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, doing business at &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (the &ldquo;Receiving Party&rdquo; and together with the Disclosing Party, the &ldquo;Parties&rdquo;).

The Recipient desires to participate in discussions regarding &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (the &ldquo;Transaction&rdquo;).  During these discussions, the Disclosing Party may share certain proprietary and confidential information with the Receiving Party upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

**Definition of Confidential Information**

For purposes of this Agreement, &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means any data or information that is proprietary to the Disclosing Party and not generally known to the public, whether in tangible or intangible form, whenever and however disclosed, including but not limited to: (i) any marketing strategies, plans, financial information, projections, operations, sales estimates, business plans, and performance results relating to the past, present or future business activities of such party, its affiliates and subsidiaries and affiliated companies; (ii) plans for products or services; (iii) customer or supplier lists; (iv) any scientific or technical information, invention, design, process, procedure, formula, improvement, technology or method; (v) any concepts, reports, data, know-how, works in progress, designs, development tools, specifications, computer software, source code, object code, flow charts, databases, inventions, information and trade secrets; and (vi) any other information that should reasonably be recognized as proprietary information of the Disclosing Party.  Confidential Information need not be novel, unique, patentable, copyrightable, or constitute a trade secret in order to be designated Confidential Information.  The Receiving Party recognizes that the Confidential Information is proprietary to the Disclosing Party, has been developed and obtained through great efforts by the Disclosing Party and that the Disclosing Party regards its Confidential Information as trade secrets.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information which: (i) was known by the Receiving Party prior to receiving the Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party; (ii) becomes known by the Receiving Party from a third-party source not known by the Receiving Party after diligent inquiry to have a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation to the Disclosing Party regarding such information;  (iii) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure in violation of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (iv) is required to be disclosed in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or is requested or required to be disclosed by law or regulation, provided that the requirements of paragraph 4 shall apply prior to any disclosure being made; and (e) is or has been independently developed by employees, consultants, agents of the Receiving Party without violation of the terms of this Agreement or reference or access to any Confidential Information.

**Disclosure of Confidential Information**

From time to time, the Disclosing Party may disclose Confidential Information to the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party will: (a) limit disclosure of any Confidential Information and notes, summaries, analyses, or other material derived in whole or in part therefrom to its officers, directors, employees, advisors, counsel, accountants, financial advisors, lenders, equity investor, agents or representatives (collectively, &ldquo;Representatives&rdquo;) with a need to know such information in connection with the Transaction and only for that purpose; (b) advise its Representatives of the proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and of the obligations set forth in this Agreement and require such Representatives to keep the Confidential Information confidential; (c) keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential by using a reasonable degree of care that is not less than the degree of care used by it in safeguarding its own confidential information; (d) not disclose any Confidential Information received by it to any third parties (except as otherwise provided for herein); and (e) except as required by applicable law, court order or rules of any governmental regulatory body or national securities exchange, not disclose (i) that Confidential Information has been made available, (ii) that the Receiving Party or its Representatives have inspected any Confidential Information, (iii) that the Receiving Party may be considering the Transaction or has had, is having or propose to have any discussions with respect thereto, or (iv) the terms, conditions and status of any Transaction.

The Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party shall each be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of their respective Representatives.

**Use of Confidential Information**

The Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information solely in connection with the current or contemplated Transaction between the Parties and not for any other purpose other than as authorized by this Agreement without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of the Disclosing Party.  No other right or license, whether express or implied, to the Confidential Information is granted to the Receiving Party hereunder.  Title to the Confidential Information will remain solely with the Disclosing Party.  All use of the Confidential Information by the Receiving Party shall be for the benefit of the Disclosing Party and any modifications or improvements thereof by the Receiving Party shall be the sole property of the Disclosing Party.  The Parties agree that their discussions in furtherance of a potential business relationship are governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 408.

**Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information**

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to any governmental, judicial or administrative order, subpoena, discovery request, regulatory request, or similar method, provided that the Receiving Party promptly notifies, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party in writing of such demand for disclosure so that the Disclosing Party, at its sole expense, may seek to make such disclosure subject to a protective order or other appropriate remedy to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; provided that, in the case of a broad regulatory request with respect to the Receiving Party's business (not targeted at the Disclosing Party), the Receiving Party may promptly comply with such request provided the Receiving Party give (if permitted by such regulator) the Disclosing Party prompt notice of such disclosure.  The Receiving Party agrees that it shall not oppose and shall cooperate, to the extent practicable, with efforts by the Disclosing Party with respect to any such request for a protective order or other relief.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Disclosing Party is unable to obtain or does not seek a protective order and the Receiving Party is legally requested or required to disclose such Confidential Information, disclosure of such Confidential Information may be made without liability.

**Term**

This Agreement shall remain in effect for a term of two years, subject to a one year extension if the Parties are still contemplating the Transaction at the end of the second year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties' duty to hold in confidence Confidential Information provided under this Agreement shall remain in effect indefinitely.

**Remedies**

The Parties understand and agree that Confidential Information to be disclosed hereunder is of a unique and valuable character and that unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would destroy or diminish the value of such information.  The Parties understand and agree that damages to the Disclosing Party resulting from the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would be impossible to calculate and that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement.  The Parties agree that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach, and the Receiving Party further agrees to waive any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.  Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Disclosing Party.  The Disclosing Party shall be entitled to recover its costs and fees, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in obtaining any such relief.  In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.

**Return of Confidential Information**

The Receiving Party shall immediately return and redeliver to the Disclosing Party all tangible material containing or embodying the Confidential Information provided hereunder and all notes, summaries, memoranda, drawings, manuals, records, excerpts or derivative information deriving therefrom and all other documents or materials (&ldquo;Notes&rdquo;) (and all copies of any of the foregoing, including copies that have been converted to computerized media in the form of image, data or word processing files either manually or by image capture or another technological means)  based on or including any Confidential Information, in whatever form of storage or retrieval, upon the earlier of: (i) the completion or termination of the dealings between the Parties contemplated hereunder; (ii) the termination of the Agreement; or (iii) at such time as the Disclosing Party may so request; provided however that the Receiving Party may retain such documents necessary to comply with document retention policies.  Alternatively, the Receiving Party may, with the written consent of the Disclosing Party, immediately destroy any of the foregoing embodying Confidential Information (including reasonably nonrecoverable erasure of computerized data) and, upon request, certify in writing such destruction by an authorized officer of the Receiving Party supervising the destruction).

**Notice of Breach**

The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by the Receiving Party or its Representatives, and will cooperate with efforts by the Disclosing Party to help the Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use.

**No Binding Agreement for Transaction**

The Parties agree that neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein.  The Parties further acknowledge and agree that each reserves the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations with respect to a Transaction at any time.  The Parties agree and acknowledge that this Agreement does not create a joint venture or partnership between them.  If a Transaction goes forward, the non-disclosure provisions of any applicable transaction documents entered into between the Parties (or their respective affiliates) for the Transaction shall supersede this Agreement.  In the event such provision is not provided for in said transaction documents, this Agreement shall control.

**Warranties**

Each party warrants that it has the right to make disclosures under this Agreement.  NO WARRANTIES ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WHATSOEVER.  The Parties acknowledge that although they shall each endeavor to include in the Confidential Information all information that they each believe relevant for the purpose of the evaluation of a Transaction, the Parties understand and agree that no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information is made by either party hereto.  The Parties agree that neither shall have any liability to the other party or to the other party's Representatives resulting from any use of the Confidential Information except with respect to disclosure of Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement.

**Miscellaneous**

This Agreement shall be governed and construed pursuant to the law of the State of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; without regard to the principles of conflict of laws thereof that would cause the laws of another jurisdiction to apply.

No failure or delay by the Parties in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions, whether oral or written, between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof.  No provision in this Agreement can be waived, modified or amended except by written consent of each party.

This Agreement may be signed by facsimile and in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall be deemed to constitute a single instrument.

Although the Parties agree that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable for the purpose of protecting the Confidential Information, if any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to violate any statute, regulation, rule, order or decree of any governmental authority, court, agency or exchange or is otherwise found to be unenforceable, the invalidity of such provision shall not be deemed to affect any other provision hereof or the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, and the invalid provision shall be deemed deleted herefrom to the minimum extent necessary to cure the violation.

Neither party may assign or transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement without prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  All obligations and rights within this Agreement shall extend to and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors, assigns and designees.

The receipt of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement will not prevent or limit in any way either party from: (i) developing, making or marketing products or services that are or may be competitive with the products and services of the other; or (ii) providing products or services to others who compete with the other.
